###What We Create
The next technical skills I will learn will probably be electronics with a focus on manufacturing with 3d printers.

The current paradigm tends to shift toward ever more refined methods and a horizontal increase of control over a technology, the tendency is the same for 3d printing and Nanotech. Right now, cheap 3d printers are enthusiast toys, they are not large enough. We will be able to print with all sorts of material, assemble material together. It will replace malls in the future, as everyone orders the piece online(but this term of course would be antiquated by then, what they have will be so much more than just the internet), the order is sent to the assembler and the machine will pop out your new sofa! I imagine families driving to this big white building to pick up the wares, but that's just the idealist in me, it will be shipped from china.
