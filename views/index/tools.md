##Tools for The Future
The tool I will master for the Future will be 3d printing (+nanotech depending how fast it develops). Right now, cheap 3d printers are enthusiast toys and edging every closer to obsolescing factories, I will be a part of it. The far future skills I will learn will be:

* network objects
* on-demand 3d printing
* cloud-based genomics computing

Everything is just information in the end, whether it is in your cellphone, speech or your brain, it is just information dancing across silica pathways, electricity jumping between neurons, DNA transcribed from cell to cell. Everything is just a pretty patterns dancing across some medium and one day soon the barrier between circuits and our minds will dissolve. The first AI will not be some emotionless machine but humans upgraded.
