##Tools for The Future
Whether it is design or space, the future approaches in different forms: one can either adapt to the wave or get run over by it. So in the future I will want to work with 3d printers; now enthusiast toys - it is edging every closer to obsolescing factories, I will also be looking closely at:

* network objects
* on-demand 3d printing
* cloud-based genomics computing

Everything is just information in the end, whether it is in your cellphone, speech or your brain, it is just information dancing across silica pathways, electricity jumping between neurons, DNA transcribed from cell to cell.Soon the barrier between circuits and our minds will dissolve.
