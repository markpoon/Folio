##Biography

I design and make things, generally with a computer or in the kitchen. I think about design and how it interacts with behaviour to vector in on what is valuable to people. I started of designed webpages using notepad on windows 3 and uploaded them onto geocities. Then, I got these pieces of paper that proves I know things about graphic design and managing space programs. 

At school I started exploring different mediums to work in, web design, 3d modelling, audio/video, print, plastic prototyping, metalsmithing. I create things. Then, I won a contest and was awarded a job researching technology, genetics, nanotech and futurist subjects pertaining to the design of products. This changed the way I saw the world and what I could be, I spent about two years freelancing in web design and graphic design. Then another making graphics and user interface at a software company.

2008 reared it's ugly head and with the help of a European Space Agency scholarship, I spent a year in Europe learning the breath of subjects related to the global space industry, focusing on commercializing the ISS and remote sensing for illegal fishing on the high seas. I lived on an ex-airforce base at NASA in the heart of the Silicon Valley and made a bid for an SBIR to create an ISS modular experimentation platform with three friends friends from university.

Some Legal blah blah blah happened and I had to come back to Toronto. The barrier of entry to being an Entrepreneur is falling, I will be a Coder, Designer, Marketer, all rolled into one. I can take things from beginning to end and am becoming increasing proficient at it.
