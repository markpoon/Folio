##Biography

I design and make things, generally with a computer or in the kitchen. I think about design and how it interacts with behaviour in order to define what is valuable to people. When I was little, I started off by designed webpages using notepad on windows 3 and geocities which eventually transformed into degrees in graphic design and managing space programs.

At school, I started exploring different mediums to work in, web design, 3d modelling, audio/video, print, plastic prototyping and metalsmithing.  Then, I won a contest and was awarded a job researching technology, genetics, nanotech and futurist subjects pertaining to product design. This changed what design, business and technology meant to me, I spent about two years freelancing web and graphic design. Then another year making graphics and the user interface at a software company.

When the 2008 financial crisis hit, I decided to go on an epic adventure and see the world. With the help of a scholarship from ESA,I spent a year in Europe learning the breath of subjects related to the global space industry. I focused on commercializing the ISS and remote sensing for illegal fishing on the high seas. I lived on an ex-airforce base at NASA in the heart of the Silicon Valley and responded to an RFP to create a modular experimentation platform with three friends from university. I got to visit Starcity in Russia, and in Moscow, they have the first spacecraft man has ever flown in, Yuri Gagarin's Capsule.
