###Biography
I make things, generally with a computer or in the kitchen. I think about design and how it interacts with behaviour to vector in on what is value to people, I have programming skills to facilitate in it's creation.

I designed webpages using notepad on windows 3 and uploaded them onto geocities. I got these pieces of paper that says I know graphic design and managing space programs. I was a researcher at a think tank working on designing better products. I designed GUIs at a software company and did the required freelancing with small businesses/design firms/shady individuals.

Design as a field depends entirely on the mode of display which is now clearly digital. Print is dead, get over it. So I taught myself programming in Ruby to handle Development as well, and will be moving into iOS next.
