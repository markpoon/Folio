##A Sense of Purpose

You know the thing about purpose is that there are only really three options to choose from in life, first and most chosen is to simply have no purpose, you never figured it out, it had always eluded you. Second you found it and turns it somewhere in the vicinity of incredibly hard to impossible to do without significant sacrifices. Or Third, you found a good enough substitute and you just settled for less.

I started with very little but I never settled for less, from drawing pretty things on a computer, to blossomed into some understanding on being persuasive through design and a general exploration of computers. At school I started exploring different things, working with web design, 3d, audio/video and print in general and that became more physical in college, plastics, metals. I create things, but how and what was interchangeable, none matter more than any other.

I won a contest for a job researching technology, genetics, nanotech, futurist subjects and applied it as a compass for designing products. This marked a change in the way I saw the world because I spent time doing and talking about things that were not commonly spoken about, I spent about two years freelancing in web design and graphic design and another making/directed the general graphics and user interface at a software company. 

I spent a year in Europe learning the breath of subjects related to the global space industry, commercialization of the ISS, remote sensing for illegal fishing on the high seas. I lived an ex airforce base at NASA in Mountainview and made a bid for an SBIR to create a modular experimentation platform with three friends friends from school.
